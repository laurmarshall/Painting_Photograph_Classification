## Background and Motivation
As an avid painter and art lover I have always been interested in analyzing different types of artwork, as well as combining my passion for art with machine learning. I am interesting in seeing how photorealist painters like [Chuck Close](http://chuckclose.com/) (see his early work), social media filters, and my own paintings perform in my model.

## The Data
The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/iiplutocrat45ii/painting-vs-photograph-classification-dataset?select=Raw+Data) consists of over 5,000 images, roughly 1,400 paintings and 3,700 photographs from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). This dataset is broken down into raw data that can be used for your own train/validation/test process. As well as already established train, validation, and test folders.
